<p><strong><u>Project Title:</u></strong> Player State Influences on Computer Game Performance and Experience </p>
    <p><strong><u>Researcher(s):</u></strong> Dr. Regan Mandryk, Professor, Department of Computer Science, University of Saskatchewan, <a href="mailto:regan@cs.usask.ca">regan@cs.usask.ca</a>. Dr. Madison Klarkowski, Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, 306-966-8940, <a href="mailto:m.klarkowski@usask.ca">m.klarkowski@usask.ca</a>. Rafael Heinze, MSc Student, Department of Computer science, <a href="mailto:raa320@usask.ca">rafael.heinze@usask.ca</a></p>
    <p><strong><u>Purpose(s) and Objective(s) of the Research: </u></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>The purpose of this project is to study performance in a computer game under varying emotional states.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><u>Procedures:</u></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>In this study, you will be asked to complete surveys in which you are asked questions about yourself (regarding demographic information and emotional states), complete a mental arithmetic task to induce a physiological response, play a third-person shooter game, and answer surveys inquiring about your gameplay experience.</li>
    <li>We will record you gameplay footage. These recordings will not be shared publicly and will only be viewed by the research team for the purpose of analysis.</li>
    <li>In addition, we will record your physiological data throughout the study. This includes heart rate and galvanic skin response data.</li>
    <li>Please feel free to ask any questions regarding the procedures and goals of the study or your role.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><u>Funded by:</u></strong> The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).</p>
    <p><strong><u>Potential Risks: </u></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>There are no known or anticipated risks to you by participating in this specific research project<strong>.</strong></li>
    <li>There is always a risk of minor anxiety or stress associated with participating in an experiment.</li>
    <li>Some of the survey questions may prompt you to reflect on your life and feel emotional discomfort as a result of that process. If you feel like you need to talk to someone about your life and well-being, check out the&nbsp;<a href="http://crisistext.org/">Crisis Text Line</a>. Further, you can contact the <a href="https://students.usask.ca/health/centres/wellness-centre.php">Student Wellness Centre</a> at the University of Saskatchewan for help with health and well-being.</li>
    <li><strong>The following task may include to complete a challenging arithmetic task to induce physiological reaction. As noted above, you are free to withdraw without penalty at any time. Participant discretion is advised. </strong></li>
    <li>At the end of the study, we will provide you with resources to help elevate your mood if you feel anxiety or stress.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><u>Potential Benefits:</u></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Your participation will help us to design games, including serious games designed to promote well-being, and contribute to the scientific understanding of the potential benefits of playing games.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><u>Compensation:</u></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>To thank you for participating, we will provide you with a $20 honorarium.</li>
    <li>The entire experiment should take approximately 60 minutes to complete.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><u>Confidentiality:</u></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the study. The entire process and data will be anonymized. Data will only be presented in the aggregate and any individual user comments will be anonymized prior to presentation in academic venues.</li>
    <li>Vignettes of system use that may include photographs or video representations of you will only be shown in academic presentations with your explicit written permission, after having been given the opportunity to review the photo or video of the interaction.</li>
    <li>Recordings taken and used for analysis (i.e., heart rate or galvanic skin response) will be only viewed by the principal investigator and their research assistants and will not be shared on any public forum.</li>
    <li>Only the principal researcher and their research assistants will have access to the data to ensure that your confidentiality is protected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><u>Storage of Data:</u></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Data (including survey and interview responses, logs of computer use, and videos of interaction) will be stored on a secure password-protected server for 7 years after data collection.</li>
    <li>After 7 years, the data will be destroyed. Paper data will be shredded and digital data will be wiped from hard disks beyond any possibility for data recovery.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><u>Right to Withdraw:</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Your participation is voluntary and you can answer only those questions that you are comfortable with. You may withdraw from the research project for any reason, at any time without explanation or penalty of any sort.</li>
    <li>Should you wish to withdraw, you may do so at any point without penalty, and we will not use your data; we will destroy all records of your data immediately, and your recordings will not be uploaded to our server (or deleted if you have already completed the experiment).</li>
    <li>Your right to withdraw data from the study will apply until the data have been aggregated (one week after study completion). After this date, it is possible that some form of research dissemination will have already occurred and it may not be possible to withdraw your data.</li>
    <li>To withdraw, send an email to <a href="mailto:madison@cs.usask.ca">madison@cs.usask.ca</a> with your name.</li>
    </ul>
